        </section>

          <section class="para-1">
            <p>In the past month, Bangladesh has once again found itself in the global spotlight. Student-led protests, 
              which began in early July 2024 with demands to reform the quota system in government jobs, culminated in the 
              resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on August 5. On the same day, she fled the country, but not before 
              her security forces had allegedly killed hundreds of student protesters across Bangladesh. Western media outlets 
              scrambled to cover the dramatic turn of events, with striking photos of protesters storming the Prime Minister's 
              residence dominating the homepages of major news outlets. While these moments of intense coverage are often crisis-driven, 
              they also raise a broader question: What do Western media outlets talk about when they talk about Bangladesh?</p>
          </section>

          <section class="para-1">
            <p>Over the past decade, Western outlets like BBC, CNN, Fox, The Telegraph, The Guardian, and The New York Times have 
              followed a pretty familiar pattern when it comes to Bangladesh. Coverage tends to spike during big disasters—think the 
              Rana Plaza collapse or the Rohingya crisis. But what about when there's no major crisis? To dig deeper, I analyzed nearly 
              2,000 articles from 2012 to 2024 to spot the recurring themes that shape how the world sees this country.</p>
          </section>

          <section class="para-1">
            <p>I focused on six major news outlets from the US and UK, chosen for their top rankings on SimilarWeb. These two countries play a big 
              role in shaping global media narratives, reaching millions of readers. By looking at how these outlets cover Bangladesh, we get a glimpse 
              of how the country is framed for audiences in two of the world’s biggest media markets. Using "Bangladesh" as my keyword, I pulled articles 
              from 2012 to June 2024 to see how these media giants are shaping the conversation.</p>

          <section class="para-1">
            <p>To better understand how Western media covers Bangladesh, I analyzed nearly 2,000 articles published between 2012 and 2024 by 
              six major news outlets. By applying machine learning techniques, I categorized these stories into themes such as politics, natural disasters,
              refugee crises, and labor issues. These categories reveal not just what makes the news, but also how the narratives are shaped. 
              Moments of heightened media attention—such as the Rohingya refugee crisis or the Rana Plaza collapse—tend to drive coverage, while stories outside 
              of these crises often reflect broader, ongoing issues that define how Bangladesh is portrayed globally. </p>

                has been framed in global media coverage over the years.</div>
            </div>
            <div class="step-chart"> <!-- Second scrolly step -->
              <div class="element2">Two moments dominate the timeline: May 2013 and July–September 2016. In May 2013, the Rana Plaza factory 
                collapse, which claimed over 1,200 lives, brought Bangladesh into the global spotlight. Three years later, a deadly terrorist 
                attack in Dhaka once again pushed the country to the top of the headlines. These two events marked the highest peaks of media 
                coverage in the last decade.</div>
            </div>
            <div class="step-chart"> <!-- Third scrolly step -->
              <div class="element3">Coverage is heavily skewed toward negative stories—crime, politics, and disasters dominate. 
                Crime alone accounts for nearly 14% of all stories (265 articles), followed closely by politics (260) and sports (255). 
                In contrast, topics like the economy, business, and culture barely make a dent. The economy, for instance, 
                is featured in just 1.4% of the coverage (27 articles), and business even less at under 1% (18 articles). 
                It’s clear that the focus leans toward crises rather than the everyday life or growth of the nation.</div>

          <h2>Mapping the Media's Lens: Where Coverage is Concentrated</h2>
        </section>
        <br></br>

        <section class="para-1">
          <p>Each country has a few places that are better known, and media coverage tends to concentrate on those hotspots—often 
            because major events happen there, or they are the capital or key economic centers. Bangladesh is no different. 
            To explore this pattern, I used algorithms to extract every place name mentioned in the 2,000 articles and mapped them to 
            the country’s 64 districts. My goal was to see if the media’s focus is spread across the entire country or concentrated in 
            just a few familiar regions. This analysis helps reveal whether the coverage offers a full picture of Bangladesh or repeatedly 
            focuses on the same areas.</p>

              <p>The map shows the places mentioned by BBC when they talk about Bangladesh. Even though BBC has the least coverage of 
                Dhaka compared to the other outlets, the capital still dominates, making up 65% of the mentions. Chittagong follows with 13%, 
              and Sylhet comes in at 5%. The rest of the country? Almost entirely overlooked.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="step" data-step="2">
              <p>Fox News gives the most coverage to Dhaka, with 83% of their mentions focused on places within the district. 
                The only other place that even registers is Chittagong, with just 4%. The rest of the country? Almost completely off the radar</p>

            <div class="step" data-step="3">
              <p>When looking at the combined map for all publications, the pattern is clear: Dhaka dominates. 
                It’s mentioned 73% of the time, with Chittagong coming in at just 8%. In fact, three-quarters of international media’s 
                coverage of Bangladesh is really just coverage of Dhaka. The rest of the country barely gets a mention.

        <section class="para-1">
          <p>The words we choose shape the stories we tell, and the ones that come up the most can reveal what’s really being emphasized. 
            By pulling out the top 100 words from each publication, I wanted to get at the recurring themes that drive how Bangladesh is 
            talked about. Whether it’s politics, disasters, or something else, these words tell us what makes it into the headlines again 
            and again. Looking at them gives us a clearer picture of what global media sees as important when they cover Bangladesh.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="para-1">
          <p>In the chart, each of the most frequent words is represented by a thin vertical bar, stacked to show how often they appear 
            across all publications. But it goes deeper—when you select a bar, it reveals the frequency of that word over time, from 2012 
            to mid-2024. This lets you see not only how often a word is used overall, but also how its importance has changed over the years. 
            It’s a way to track the evolution of key themes and see how certain topics rise and fall in the media’s coverage of Bangladesh.</p>

          <p>Bangladesh’s story in Western media follows a familiar pattern—focused on crises and centered mostly around Dhaka. 
            Political events, disasters, and labor issues dominate, while other stories and regions fall into the background. 
            Interestingly, despite all the talk about climate risks, climate-related words don’t even crack the top 100. Instead, 
            moments like the Rana Plaza collapse highlight the media’s focus on Bangladesh’s garment industry.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="para-1">
          <p>These patterns give us a snapshot of how the country is framed internationally. It’s clear that certain narratives take 
            the spotlight, while others don’t get the same attention. By looking at the words and places most often mentioned, we can 
            start to see how the media shapes our understanding of Bangladesh—and what might be missing from the bigger picture.</p>
