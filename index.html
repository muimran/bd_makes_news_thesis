            <h1>When Bangladesh Makes News in the West</h1>
            <p>For this research, I started by gathering relevant news articles from major Western 
                outlets using a two-stage web scraping process. While I initially aimed to include top 
                newspapers from ten Western countries, I decided to narrow the focus to the top three news 
                websites from the US and the UK due to time constraints. I chose these sites based on SimilarWeb 
                rankings to make sure they reflected mainstream media in these regions, and I concentrated on 
                articles published from 2000 onwards to keep the data consistent and manageable.</p>

            <p>To analyse the large body of text in this research, I began by defining key questions: What can be asked of the text corpus? 
                Who appears in it? What themes and geographic areas are mentioned? How often are certain adjectives used? Which other countries are 
                referenced? And who else is mentioned in the articles?
                I used several Python tools for this analysis. NLTK helped break down the text and remove common words, while spaCy identified names, 
                locations, and parts of speech. Gensim was used to uncover themes through topic modeling. Finally, I employed Matplotlib and Seaborn 
                to create visual representations of the findings.
                This approach allowed me to efficiently process and analyze the text, extracting valuable
                 insights and addressing the key questions I set out to explore.
