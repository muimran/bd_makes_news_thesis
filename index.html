            western publications to see how Western media has framed the country over the last 12 years. 
            Familiar tropes emerge alongside surprise findings!</p>
          </section>
          <section class="para-1">
            <p>This summer, Bangladesh has once again found itself in the global spotlight. 
              Student-led protests began in early July 2024 with demands to reform how government jobs are allocated, 
              and culminated in the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on August 5. She fled the country, but not 
              before her security forces had allegedly killed hundreds of student protesters across Bangladesh. Western media 
              outlets scrambled to cover the dramatic turn of events, with striking photos of protesters storming the Prime Minister's 
              residence dominating the homepages of major news outlets. While these moments of intense coverage are often crisis-driven, 
              they also raise a broader question: What do Western media outlets talk about when they talk about Bangladesh?</p>
          </section>

          <section class="para-1">
            <p>Outlets like BBC, CNN, Fox, The Telegraph, The Guardian, and The New York Times follow a pretty familiar pattern when 
              it comes to Bangladesh. Coverage tends to spike during big disasters—think the Rana Plaza collapse or the Rohingya crisis. 
              But what about when there's no major crisis? To dig deeper, I analyzed nearly 2,000 articles from 2012 to 2024 to spot the 
              recurring themes that show how the world sees this country.</p>
          </section>

          <section class="para-1">
            <p>I focused on six major news outlets from the US and UK, selected for being the most-visited, according 
              to <a href="https://www.similarweb.com">SimilarWeb</a>, which ranks sites by how much traffic they get. 
              They reach millions of readers and by looking at how they cover Bangladesh, we get a glimpse of how the country 
              is framed for audiences in two of the world’s biggest media markets. Using "Bangladesh" as my keyword, I pulled articles 
              from 2012 to June 2024 to see how these media giants are shaping the conversation.</p>

          <br></br>

          <section class="para-1">
            <p>I analyzed nearly 2,000 articles and categorized these stories into themes such as politics, natural disasters, 
              refugee crises, and labor issues. These categories reveal not just what makes the news, but also how the narratives 
              are shaped. Moments of heightened media attention—such as the Rohingya refugee crisis or the Rana Plaza collapse—tend 
              to drive coverage, while stories outside of these crises often reflect broader, ongoing issues that define how Bangladesh 
              is portrayed globally. </p>

                and sports. In contrast, the economy, business, and culture barely make a dent. The economy and business each make up 
                around 1% of all the articles. It’s clear the focus leans toward crises rather than the everyday life or growth of the nation.</div>

                In fact, nearly three-quarters of all Bangladesh-related sports coverage across these outlets comes from The Guardian, a 
                striking contrast to the crime-heavy coverage elsewhere.</div>

        <br></br>

        <section class="para-1">
          <p>Each country has a few places that are better known, and media coverage tends to concentrate on those hotspots—often because
             major events happen there, or they are the big cities or key economic centers. Bangladesh is no different. To explore this pattern, 
             I extracted every place name mentioned in the 2,000 articles and mapped them to the country’s 64 districts. My goal was to see if the 
             media’s focus is spread across the entire country or concentrated in just a few familiar regions. This analysis helps reveal whether 
             the coverage offers a full picture of Bangladesh or repeatedly focuses on the same areas.</p>

                13%, and Sylhet in the north-east corner comes in at 5%. The rest of the country is almost entirely overlooked.</p>

              <p><strong>Fox News</strong> gives the most coverage to Dhaka, with 83% of their mentions focused on places within the district.

            <div class="step" data-step="3">
              <p>When looking at the combined map for <strong>all publications</strong>, the pattern is clear: Dhaka dominates. Three-quarters of all places mentioned 
                are in or around the capital, with the second city Chittagong coming in at just 8%. In fact, the international media’s coverage of 
                Bangladesh is really just coverage of Dhaka. The rest of the country barely gets a mention.

            every country mentioned alongside Bangladesh in 2,000 articles, I found that its story is frequently told through its 
            connections with the wider world. Be it in times of conflict or cooperation, these links offer a glimpse into Bangladesh’s

              <p>The Guardian ties Bangladesh to 80 different countries in its coverage, more than any other outlet. 
                A big part of this likely comes from their focus on sports coverage, especially cricket. As one of the top 
                cricket-playing nations in the world, Bangladesh's international connections often play out through the sport. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="step2" data-step="2">
              <p>One surprising thing about The Guardian’s coverage is how often Africa comes up. 
                A quarter of the countries it mentions alongside Bangladesh are African; more than any other publication. </p>

            <div class="step2" data-step="3">
              <p>On the flip side, CNN’s coverage of Bangladesh is much narrower. They mention only about 50 other countries in 
                their reporting. Half of those are in Asia, with Myanmar standing out the most — not a surprise, given how much attention 
                the Rohingya crisis has received in their reporting.</p>

            <div class="step2" data-step="4">
              <p>Overall, Bangladesh's neighbours account for nearly 40% of the mentions, with India being the most prominent at 16%. 
                The majority of the remaining mentions go to the UK, USA, and European countries. A significant portion of the UK's mentions

    METHOD
  </h2>

  <p style="font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #666666; text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">
    For this research, I pulled together news articles from six major outlets—three from the UK and three from the US. 
    I picked these based on SimilarWeb rankings to make sure I was looking at the most visited and influential sites 
    in both regions. The articles I focused on spanned from <strong>1 January 2012 to 30 June 2024</strong>.
  </p>

  <p style="font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #666666; text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">
    The first step was to track down all the URLs for articles that had "Bangladesh" or "Bangladeshi" in the headlines. 
    I used a mix of methods for this: For sites like <em>The New York Times</em> and <em>The Guardian</em>, I used their APIs to easily grab the links. 
    For other outlets, I wrote some custom scripts and used a tool called Octoparse to speed up the scraping. 
    For BBC, where scraping was trickier, I used Google’s site search to find the relevant articles. 
    To automate everything, I turned to <strong>Selenium</strong>, <strong>Pandas</strong>, and <strong>BeautifulSoup</strong>. 
    All the URLs were saved in a CSV file for easy access later on.
  </p>

  <p style="font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #666666; text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">
    Getting the content from these articles wasn't always straightforward. Some sites used dynamic loading, meaning the full content only appeared 
    after scrolling or interacting with the page. To handle this, I used <strong>Selenium</strong> to automate those actions, making sure I captured everything. 
    Once I had the content, I saved it, along with important metadata like publication dates and author names, in <strong>JSON</strong> format. 
    Afterward, I double-checked the data to ensure it was accurate and complete.
  </p>

  <p style="font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #666666; text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">
    With the articles in hand, I started asking some big questions: What are the main stories being told about Bangladesh? Who and what get mentioned the most? 
    What topics, places, and adjectives keep coming up? And which other countries are linked to Bangladesh in these stories?
  </p>

  <p style="font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #666666; text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">
    To get the place names, I created a custom dictionary that included all the sub-districts, districts, and city corporations in Bangladesh, 
    as well as major cities and countries around the world. Running this list through the article text helped me capture all the geographic mentions accurately.
  </p>

  <p style="font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #666666; text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">
    For the actual text analysis, I used a few Python tools. <strong>NLTK</strong> helped me clean up the text by removing common filler words, 
    while <strong>spaCy</strong> was key for identifying names, places, and other important entities. 
    <strong>Gensim</strong> allowed me to uncover the main themes using topic modeling, helping me see what subjects came up the most in the articles.
  </p>

  <p style="font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #666666; text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">
    This approach let me dive deep into the data and focus on how Bangladesh was being portrayed across the different news outlets I analyzed.
